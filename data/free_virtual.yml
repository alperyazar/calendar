      Historically, safety and security have been issues focussed on application or real-time processors, but with the recent arrival of high-frequency and edge devices it has become critical within microcontrollers too. Where software assets protection, system IP security, and dynamic memory management had sometimes been treated as an afterthought, these aspects are now considered fundamental for sound, future-proof firmware development.

      The Arm® v-8M architecture has been designed to enable essential security features in the latest processors whilst retaining an efficient, deterministic code base.

      In this webinar we will:

      examine the modern micro-architectural features available with Arm Cortex®-M that can be used to improve the overall quality of embedded designs
      contrast the features found inside the latest Arm v-8M processors (such as the Cortex-M33) with the established Cortex-M3/M4
      highlight the relatively simple steps needed to include safety features provided by the Cortex-M33. This will be illustrated using NXP's MCUXpresso development environment.

      FPGA-Based Deep Learning (DNN) Accelerator

      Recent research in the Artificial Intelligence domain have shown significant advantage in Machine learning over traditional algorithms based on handcrafted features and models. Along with availability of credible data and computation resources, researchers are using layered Neural Networks (Deep Learning) for solving various image, speech and video recognition tasks. But the high computation and storage complexity of neural network inference impose great challenges for effective application. Besides, CPUs and GPUSs, FPGAs are becoming a platform candidate to achieve energy efficient neural network processing. In this webinar, we will cover Xilinx strategies to accelerate these algorithms for real-time inference on their hardware.

      What is SystemC and how is it used?
      What does modern SystemC code look like?
      What differentiates SystemC from SystemVerilog?
      What use cases best fit SystemC?
      What is TLM?
      Where can I learn more?

      The session will be presented by David C Black, Doulos Senior Member of Technical Staff and co-author of "SystemC: From the Ground Up". It will consist of a one-hour session, (see below for details) and will be interactive with Q&A participation from delegates.

      We will show how to implement, train, and run a simple neural network model, taking advantage of the Keras API used by TensorFlow, because very few people code neural networks from scratch in Python these days. Along the way, we will describe some of the machine learning principles being used, although the focus here is on the coding, not the theory.

      The webinar will explore the Python language features needed both to prepare datasets and to code and train neural network models and examine the options available for using Python across the whole machine learning flow, from data gathering and curation through model training to deployment.

      In this session we will discuss about these digital-centric mixed signal verification methodologies to improve SoC verification throughput and improve time to market.

      The digitalization trend is resulting in increased semiconductor content in everything from automobiles to appliances to factories. Chips are getting bigger, better, and more sophisticated. As designs complexity has multiplied, verification complexity has exploded. Verification has become an art of applying many unique methodologies for each of the different classes of sub-design within a design. The advent of new technologies — such as constrained-random data generation, assertion-based verification, coverage-driven verification, formal model checking and Intelligent Testbench Automation to name a few — have changed the way we see functional verification productivity. However, most of these advanced new technologies have not been extended to verify mixed signal design challenges.

      Attend this session and learn how digital-centric mixed-signal verification methodologies including real number modeling, UVM-AMS and UPF-MS can be used to improve SoC verification throughput and improve time to market.

      The primary goal in safely implementing any IC or FPGA project is to achieve a synchronous design. This implies that the relationship of all clocks and asynchronous resets to each other is defined in the synthesis constraints.
      Incorrect handling of clock-domain crossing (CDC) is probably the primary cause of sporadic errors, which are impossible to catch in a digital simulation and can cause a system to inexplicably fail in the field.

      This webinar discusses situations in which CDC problems can occur and more importantly presents solutions for the most frequent scenarios.

      OSTree is a library widely adopted for the implementation of robust and secure frameworks for over-the-air (OTA) updates of Embedded Linux systems.
      OSTree introduces a number of novel and potentially challenging techniques, even for experienced developers familiar with a more traditional embedded Linux distribution.
      For example, OSTree allows for multiple Linux distributions to be stored on a single filesystem and each modified root filesystem (tree) is committed to a Git-like repository.
