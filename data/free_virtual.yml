      Creating a RTL Kernel: from HDL to reusable packaged Kernel

      This webinar reviews the acceleration design flow with Vitis tools. While high-level design entry methods range from HLS to Model Composer, there are provisions for re-using RTL modules in this flow. This presentation also explains the steps and dependencies to seamlessly fit legacy RTL code into acceleration design flows.

      In this webinar, Doulos Senior Member of Technical Staff, David C Black, will introduce the key concepts of randomization and constraints in SystemVerilog.

      As well as the principles of Constrained Random Verification, you will be provided with an overview of the language constructs to support this, the generation of data and methods for constraining the data.

      You will also learn about numerous randomization features and the many approaches for configuration and control.

      All the examples are supported by working code that you can run on Doulos' free simulation environment EDA Playground using the Questa Advanced Simulator from our webinar partner Siemens.

      We're now fully in the 2nd wave of 5G New Radio, and wireless system designers are racing even faster to meet more aggressive compute, power, and cost constraints for mass NR deployment. The Zynq® RFSoC DFE delivers 2X performance/watt versus Zynq UltraScale+™ RFSoC Gen 3 by combining hardened digital front-end IP cores with adaptive logic. This new class of radio platforms balances the flexibility of an FPGA, cost economies of an ASIC, and the RF-Analog integration only found in Zynq RFSoCs.

      In this hour-long presentation, we'll cover the following:

      The latest 5G Market Dynamics and the need for flexible and cost-effective radio variants
      A technical overview of the hardened radio cores and their performance/power advantages
      A demonstration of our 5G O-RU targeted reference design on the evaluation kit
      How to get started with the ZCU670 evaluation kit
      We'll also leave plenty of time for questions with our product line manager.

      For the experienced Zynq RFSoC developers, there's a lot new in this next generation architecture you'll want to understand. For those new to Zynq RFSoC—this may be the platform for you.

      Historically, safety and security have been issues focussed on application or real-time processors, but with the recent arrival of high-frequency and edge devices it has become critical within microcontrollers too. Where software assets protection, system IP security, and dynamic memory management had sometimes been treated as an afterthought, these aspects are now considered fundamental for sound, future-proof firmware development.

      The Arm® v-8M architecture has been designed to enable essential security features in the latest processors whilst retaining an efficient, deterministic code base.

      In this webinar we will:

      examine the modern micro-architectural features available with Arm Cortex®-M that can be used to improve the overall quality of embedded designs
      contrast the features found inside the latest Arm v-8M processors (such as the Cortex-M33) with the established Cortex-M3/M4
      highlight the relatively simple steps needed to include safety features provided by the Cortex-M33. This will be illustrated using NXP's MCUXpresso development environment.

      FPGA-Based Deep Learning (DNN) Accelerator

      Recent research in the Artificial Intelligence domain have shown significant advantage in Machine learning over traditional algorithms based on handcrafted features and models. Along with availability of credible data and computation resources, researchers are using layered Neural Networks (Deep Learning) for solving various image, speech and video recognition tasks. But the high computation and storage complexity of neural network inference impose great challenges for effective application. Besides, CPUs and GPUSs, FPGAs are becoming a platform candidate to achieve energy efficient neural network processing. In this webinar, we will cover Xilinx strategies to accelerate these algorithms for real-time inference on their hardware.

      SystemC has become well-established as the language of choice for system modeling and virtual platform creation and integration, and is now being applied successfully for high level synthesis. SystemC models also frequently appear as reference models in the hardware verification flow.

      This session is aimed at hands-on hardware or software engineers who might know Verilog or C but have no previous experience of SystemC. It will explain what you need to know to be successful with SystemC by exploring some fundamental questions including:

      What is SystemC and how is it used?
      What does modern SystemC code look like?
      What differentiates SystemC from SystemVerilog?
      What use cases best fit SystemC?
      What is TLM?
      Where can I learn more?

      The session will be presented by David C Black, Doulos Senior Member of Technical Staff and co-author of "SystemC: From the Ground Up". It will consist of a one-hour session, (see below for details) and will be interactive with Q&A participation from delegates.

      As the demands on compute performance increase across many applications, more emphasis is being placed on higher levels of optimization for the algorithms being implemented.

      This webinar will examine methodologies for host optimization in the Versal ACAP device. The Versal ACAP is a heterogeneous compute platform containing multiple resources enabling different models of computation to be implemented very efficiently. We will investigate processing capabilities in the Versal ACAP device and options for implementing functions using the Vitis Software Platform and the Vivado ML design suite. We will also explore optimization methodologies and best practices when architecting these highly complex systems.

      Attendees will learn how code vectorization, compiler directives, and C coding style can all be used to provide host optimization. Device resource utilization and code profiling will also be discussed.

      In this webinar, you will:

      - See how to use Xilinx tools to explore, profile, and optimize host code and hardware acceleration kernels
      - Learn about Xilinx software analysis and simulation flows

      In this webinar, you will learn to identify when and where to use flowcharts vs. state machines in your software designs.

      Flowcharts tend to be overused when designing software, especially when trying to manage more complex embedded applications. You will be given a brief history of flowcharts and state machines along with an overview of the Unified Modeling Language (UML). The webinar will emphasize the use of state machines for designing and implementing stateful embedded software in a variety of potential applications.

      In this webinar we will take a fresh look at both Python and Machine Learning.

      We will show how to implement, train, and run a simple neural network model, taking advantage of the Keras API used by TensorFlow, because very few people code neural networks from scratch in Python these days. Along the way, we will describe some of the machine learning principles being used, although the focus here is on the coding, not the theory.

      The webinar will explore the Python language features needed both to prepare datasets and to code and train neural network models and examine the options available for using Python across the whole machine learning flow, from data gathering and curation through model training to deployment.

      Doulos Co-Founder & Technical Fellow John Aynsley will teach the core principles necessary to understand and use SystemVerilog Assertions, focussing on the aspects of SVA that are applicable to both formal verification and simulation.

      Particular emphasis will be placed on the core semantics of temporal logic so that you will be able to write your own assertions, understand what you are doing, and avoid the many pitfalls that trap beginners.

      SVA is really not hard if you approach it properly!
