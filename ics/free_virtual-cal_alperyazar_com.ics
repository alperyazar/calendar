UID:04f6fcf4-65d4-440a-93e3-204ab156a217@04f6.org
DESCRIPTION:FPGA-Based Deep Learning (DNN) Accelerator\n\nRecent research 
 in the Artificial Intelligence domain have shown significant advantage in 
 Machine learning over traditional algorithms based on handcrafted features
  and models. Along with availability of credible data and computation 
 resources\, researchers are using layered Neural Networks (Deep Learning) 
 for solving various image\, speech and video recognition tasks. But the 
 high computation and storage complexity of neural network inference impose
  great challenges for effective application. Besides\, CPUs and GPUSs\, 
 FPGAs are becoming a platform candidate to achieve energy efficient neural
  network processing. In this webinar\, we will cover Xilinx strategies to 
 accelerate these algorithms for real-time inference on their 
 hardware.\n\nhttps://www.plc2.com/en/training/detail/vitis-ai-creating-an-

SUMMARY:Using Python to Implement a Complete Machine Learning Flow
UID:3a2b0c26-bee9-4960-a853-e1e9c90bd187@3a2b.org
DESCRIPTION:In this webinar we will take a fresh look at both Python and 
 Machine Learning.\n\nWe will show how to implement\, train\, and run a 
 simple neural network model\, taking advantage of the Keras API used by 
 TensorFlow\, because very few people code neural networks from scratch in 
 Python these days. Along the way\, we will describe some of the machine 
 learning principles being used\, although the focus here is on the

SUMMARY:Democratization of Digital-Centric Methodologies for Analog and 
 Mixed-Signal Verification
UID:8ffc3205-7089-4c25-b46e-b8b43498ee4e@8ffc.org
DESCRIPTION:In this session we will discuss about these digital-centric 
 mixed signal verification methodologies to improve SoC verification 
 throughput and improve time to market.\n\nThe digitalization trend is 
 resulting in increased semiconductor content in everything from 
 automobiles to appliances to factories. Chips are getting bigger\, 
 better\, and more sophisticated. As designs complexity has multiplied\, 
 verification complexity has exploded. Verification has become an art of 
 applying many unique methodologies for each of the different classes of 
 sub-design within a design. The advent of new technologies — such as 
 constrained-random data generation\, assertion-based verification\, 
 coverage-driven verification\, formal model checking and Intelligent 
 Testbench Automation to name a few — have changed the way we see 
 functional verification productivity. However\, most of these advanced new
  technologies have not been extended to verify mixed signal design 
 challenges.\n\nAttend this session and learn how digital-centric mixed-
 signal verification methodologies including real number modeling\, UVM-AMS
  and UPF-MS can be used to improve SoC verification throughput and improve
  time to market.\n\nhttps://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3771889/AA44D616A31C1E464

SUMMARY:Clock Domain Crossing
UID:f4a71119-38dd-4026-b7ed-aaa64e8f9df4@f4a7.org
DESCRIPTION:The primary goal in safely implementing any IC or FPGA project 
 is to achieve a synchronous design. This implies that the relationship of 
 all clocks and asynchronous resets to each other is defined in the 
 synthesis constraints.\nIncorrect handling of clock-domain crossing (CDC) 
 is probably the primary cause of sporadic errors\, which are impossible to
  catch in a digital simulation and can cause a system to inexplicably fail
  in the field.\n\nThis webinar discusses situations in which CDC problems 
 can occur and more importantly presents solutions for the most frequent 
 scenarios.\n\nNote: Two time slots are available\, visit the event
